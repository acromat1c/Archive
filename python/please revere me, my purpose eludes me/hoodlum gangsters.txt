# 12.1 (The Triangle class) Design a class named Triangle that extends the GeometricObject class. The Triangle class contains:
#  Three float data fields named side1, side2, and side3 are used to denote the three sides of the triangle.
#  A constructor creates a triangle with the specified side1, side2, and side3 with default values 1.0.
#  The accessor methods for all three data fields
#  A method named getArea() returns the area of this triangle.
#  A method named getPerimeter() returns the perimeter of this triangle.
#  A method named __str__() returns a string description for the triangle.

# For the formula to compute the area of a triangle, see Programming Exercise 2.14. The __str__() method is implemented as follows:
# return "Triangle: side1 = " + str(self.__side1) +     
#    " side2 = " +     
#    str(self.__side2) + " side3 = " + str(self.__side3)

# Draw the UML diagrams for the classes Triangle and GeometricObject. Implement the Triangle class. Write a test program that 
# prompts the user to enter the three sides of the triangle, a color, and 1 or 0 to indicate whether the triangle is filled. 
# The program should create a Triangle object with these sides and set the color and filled properties using the input. 
# The program should display the triangles area, perimeter, color, and True or False to indicate whether the triangle is filled or not.

# Sample Run for Exercise12_01 This live exercise has an input box. It contains the following data: 2.5 3.1 2.8 red 1 The exercise displays the output as follows: 
# command>python Exercise12_01.py Enter side1: 2.5 Enter side2: 3.1 Enter side3: 2.8 
# Enter color: red Enter 1/0 for filled (1: true, 0: false): 1 The area is 3.3159613990515604 The perimeter is 8.399999999999999 Color is red Filled is True command>
